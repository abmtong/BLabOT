Fetch temp.
Update Power


LV comm.s uses a custom .NET node
 Command-line based

Init:
VersaHub (the source object)
VersaHub > InitVersaHub

Syntax: 'a.CMD' where a = laser module (atm, a/b/c = r/g/b )

GET temperature: a.?OBT, responds a.OBT = NN (deg C)

SET Laser Power: a.LP = NN (mW?), returns current power
Control mode: a.C = 0 ; If not already set, make laser operate on power control mode (as opposed to current control)
On/off: a.LE = 1; (0/1 = off/on)

SET to dig mod: a.PUL=1
